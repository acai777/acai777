## Hello! I'm Arno ðŸ‘‹ 

I am a Software Engineer based in Boston, MA. Prior to software development, I worked in research and analyzed healthcare data, where I realized that I enjoyed breaking down problems and building solutions to complex challenges.

Most recently, I developed [Willow](https://willow-cdc.github.io/), an open-source, self-hosted framework for building log-based change data capture pipelines that update caches in near real-time based on changes in a database.
